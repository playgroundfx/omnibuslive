Oil price down and continue into down direction.  
The Oil price follows our expectation into down direction. The lockdown
in Europe is the major factor for the falling oil price. World-
Signals.com in the forecast from October 26th predicted this scenario
with target of oil price (US Oil) at $34-$35. If you are following our
free forecasts hold this short position during the coming week because
the first target of $34-$35 is almost reached and the price may continue
down lower to levels of $32.  
The other key [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) that will move the oil price is U.S. Election of
course. If Biden takes the vote the oil price may continue down even
below $30. Biden strategy is to stop the economy to prevent the
population from the corona virus.
