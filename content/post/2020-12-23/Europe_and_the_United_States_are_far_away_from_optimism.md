**News:**  
|  In the week of holidays the market is very dynamic. The key
fundamental and geopolitical [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) comes one after another.  
The extended travel bans in Europe due to the new virus strain in the
United Kingdom is one of the factors but the end date of Brexit is the
other factor to influence the dynamic of the markets.  
The new U.S. stimul deal of $900 billion supports the Dollar as the
gains against the Euro is at about 100-120 pips. [World-Signals.com][1]
expects these gains to melt in the next few days till Christmas and
EURUSD to trade at 1.2350 and up.  
Optimism - Forget about optimism in Europe and the United States as the
lockdown will become harder and harder as the economy will almost stop
these days. Many businesses and workers will go to retirement due to
huge losses in the days when the turnover is always at record levels.
