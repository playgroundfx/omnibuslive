| **Weekly Strategy - Trump - Kim Chen Un meeting and Fed interest rates
decision on focus this week**  
---  
**News:**  
|  EURUSD (1.1796)  
Trend: Neutral/Downward  
Support/Resistance: 1.1510 - 1.1890  
The politic is more important this week than the fundamental events.
Probably the event for the year is the expecting meeting on Tuesday in
Singapore between Trump and Kim Chen Un. The results by the Singapore
meeting are important for the forex market and the Dollar.  
The other key event is from the last week in Canada. The faction in the
Group of G7 will cause influence over the financial markets and mainly
in Euro - Dollar.  
The major fundamental event is schedule for Wednesday FOMC Interest
rates decision. It is widely expecting Fed to hike the interest rates
with 25bps to 2.00%. ECB interest rates decision is schedule for
Thursday but is not expecting changes.  
As overall the events may support the Dollar as we can see levels again
back down to the key support at 1.1510. [World-Signals.com][1] trading
strategy this week as overall is to trade into neutral direction and
after the mid of the week into downward direction.
