period**

**News:**  
|  The Dollar will not win by the Trump plan for $2 trillion. [World-
Signals.com][1] expectation is temporary gains of Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P
and so on but the Dollar may lose ground against the Euro to levels of
1.14 in the coming couple of days.  
The Trump idea for battle with the Corona Virus changes too often. That
moves the market into different direction every day. Dow Jones currently
is at levels of 22100 as the recovery continues after the huge
investment plan of $2 trillion. The Dow recovery may go to levels above
24000 in the coming days. The Covid-19 spread in United States too fast
to believe that the money will help to the economy. Therefore tour
strategy to expect new low levels of Dow Jones even deeper than 18000 in
the next month.
