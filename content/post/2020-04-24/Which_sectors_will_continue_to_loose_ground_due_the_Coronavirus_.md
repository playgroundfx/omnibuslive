| **Which sectors will continue to loose ground due the Coronavirus?**  
---  
**News:**  
|  Most of them are well known for all. Everyone hopes, that they will
start recovery in a short amount of time.  
In West Europe we don't expect too early recovery, although some
restrictions are down.  
[World-Signals.com][1]  
expects the economic problem to exist beyond the reach of 2020 to 2021.  
One of the biggest structures to suffer are the tourism - ski resorts,
restaurants, bars and etc.  
Although the fact that many investments in real estates, hotels and
restaurants may go out to public sell is too early to invest there. The
bottom is far away into very low prices in a few years ahead.
