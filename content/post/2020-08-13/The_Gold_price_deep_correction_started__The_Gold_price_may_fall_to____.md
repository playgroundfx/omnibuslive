**News:**  
|  The Gold correction after the serial of 4 consecutive months of rise
is over. It is the time for deep correction down below $1850. Later is
possible the bottom to down to $1790 where the down movement is about to
end.  
These 4-months of Gold rise was widely expecting due to the starting new
stimulus for the economy. The major central banks continue with infusion
of fresh cash flows. These flows already start the inflation. It is time
for correction of the Gold price as the reach of levels of $1850 and
$1790 may happens within 1-week time and continues about a month or one
month and half at levels below $1850.

wins of at least $100 per ounce.
