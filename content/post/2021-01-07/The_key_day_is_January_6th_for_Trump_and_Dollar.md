**News:**  
|  The minimal chance of Donald Trump to save the president post is the
reason for last movements on the markets.  
The chance is too minimal but it was a reason EURUSD to keep below 1.23
in the first two business days of 2021. On 6th January 2021 is the last
key day and final decision for election of U.S. president. After the
event tomorrow EURUSD may jump over 1.24 in the day. As overall the
trend is stable in upward movement. The dollar will become weaker in the
first half of January 2021. World-Signals.com expects to see EURUSD to
test 1.25 soon.
