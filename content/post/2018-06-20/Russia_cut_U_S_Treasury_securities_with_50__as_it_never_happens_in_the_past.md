**News:**  
|  Step by step the dominant of the Dollar is close to end. Russia who
own $95 billion of U.S. Treasury securities cut it to $48 billion in
April 2018. The cut is almost 50% and if China follows Russia the
pressure over the Dollar will raise dramatically.  
Trade war that already started between United States and rest world is a
fact. The number of countries connected with the trade war raise every
day. The most affected countries are China, Germany, Canada, India, Euro
Zone and others. These countries are backing off.  
In a short-term the Dollar will gain but in long-term the effect over
the Dollar may become negative.  
[World-Signals.com][1] trading strategy is to hold short EURUSD
positions in a short-term period.
