Our last Gold target from September 3rd is reached with a good profit of
about $30 per ounce. The big movements in upward direction are ended
already from the beginning of August 2020. The [investor](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/investor-mode/)s are not willing
to bet to Gold and the price may stay at the current levels till
December. The movements are possible in the range between $1860/85 and
$1970. World-Signals.com trading strategy is to trade within the trading
range and in the next few days to hold short positions.  
Do not forget: We send everyday Gold trading signals with exact entry
and exit levels. Always use one SL and one TP. Metal Premium service
offers long-term Gold signals usually one signal per week or two but
with very high level of TP.
