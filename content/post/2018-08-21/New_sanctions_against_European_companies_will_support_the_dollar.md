| **Weekly Strategy - New sanctions against European companies will
support the dollar**  
---  
**News:**  
|  EURUSD (1.1438)  
Trend: Neutral  
Support/Resistance: 1.1300 - 1.1525  
This week we recommend focusing on Wednesday of FOMC Minutes, ECB
Monetary Policy Meeting Accounts on Thursday and Germany GDP on Friday.
But the focus is not so over the fundamentals events. The key events
that will move the Dollar is the new trade war Unites States against one
third of the world. Turkey is the last country with sanction and that
push Turkey to avoid Dollar trading. This is the last country release by
the Dollar but new countries will follow the tendency to avoid Dollar in
international trading.  
The Dollar nevertheless may continue with the gains because many new
European companies will face with sanction due to North Stream 2. This
will give a new fresh power for the dollar this week but as overall the
trading will remain into neutral direction.  
[World-Signals.com][1] trading strategy is to trade within the trading
range of 1.1300 and 1.1525 this week.
