| **Full of fundamental events this week may cause trading within the
range of EURUSD**  
---  
**News:**  
|  EURUSD (1.1334)  
Trend: Neutral  
Support/Resistance: 1.1260 - 1.1500  
The new week start with interesting [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/) from Monday. The important IFO
report followed by ECB President Draghi's Speech may set a new direction
of the trading. On Wednesday we will focus over the United States GDP
(Q3) and CPI. A large number of fundamental events will follow on
Thursday as the most important is FOMC Minutes. Friday will end with key
events for Euro Zone like Unemployment rate and CPI Index. All these
events will cause moves into both directions.  
[World-Signals.com][1] trading strategy this week is to trade within the
trading range and use both directions for trading. If the trading of
EURUSD breaks below 1.1260 then expect levels of 1.1100.
